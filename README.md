## Kotlin Calculator

This is a challenge for the kotlin bootcamp that is happening in the website called [DIO](https://digitalinnovation.one/), that's just the start of the classes, so don't expect nothing crazy in here :grin:.

The challenge is to use the skills that we've learned in the class to develop an calculator, so we'll be using the console to display and input the values.

This is my very first experience with kotlin, so feel free to send me any tips.
